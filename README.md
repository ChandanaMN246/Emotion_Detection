# Emotion_Detection

This Python project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and analyze emotions from live video feed captured by a camera. By leveraging facial recognition algorithms and machine learning models, the project can identify and classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more in real-time.

Key Features:

Real-time Emotion Detection: The project employs OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to capture video frames from the camera and detect faces within the frames.

Facial Landmark Detection: Once a face is detected, the project employs a facial landmark detection algorithm to identify key facial features, such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

Emotion Classification: Using pre-trained machine learning models, the project analyzes the facial expressions captured by the facial landmarks to determine the corresponding emotion. Common models for emotion classification include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Visual Feedback: The detected emotions are visually displayed on the video feed in real-time, providing a live representation of the detected emotions.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning (CNN), Machine Learning, Facial Landmark Detection Algorithms.
